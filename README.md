## Available Tools

### Core Reasoning Tools

| **find-model** | Find finite models satisfying premises |
| **find-counterexample** | Find counterexamples showing statements don't follow |

| **translate-text** | Translate natural language to FOL (requires LLM) |

### Session Management Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **create-session** | Create a new reasoning session with TTL |
| **assert-premise** | Add a formula to a session's knowledge base |

## Engine Selection

The `prove` tool supports automatic or explicit engine selection:

```json
{
  "name": "prove",
  "arguments": {
    "premises": ["foo | bar", "-foo"],
    "conclusion": "bar",
    "engine": "auto",
    "include_trace": true
  }
}
```

The `include_trace` option (boolean) enables step-by-step derivation output in the response, useful for debugging or understanding the proof path.

| Engine | Best For | Capabilities |
|--------|----------|--------------|
| `prolog` | Horn clauses, Datalog | Equality, arithmetic, efficient unification |
| `sat` | Propositional, Finite Domain | Boolean logic, CNF solving |
| `z3` | General FOL, SMT | Arithmetic, Quantifiers, Equality |
| `clingo` | Answer Set Programming | Constraints (Experimental) |
| `auto` | Default — selects based on formula | Analyzes clause structure & features |

### Engine Capabilities

| Engine | Strength | Arithmetic | Quantifiers | Equality | Model Size |
|--------|----------|------------|-------------|----------|------------|
| **Z3** | High (SMT) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Large |
| **Clingo** | High (ASP) | ✅ | Limited | ✅ | Large |
| **Prolog** | Medium (Resolution) | ✅ | Limited (Horn) | ✅ | Small/Medium |
| **SAT** | Low (Propositional) | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | Small |

## Formula Syntax

This server uses first-order logic (FOL) syntax compatible with Prover9:

### Quantifiers
- `all x (...)` — Universal quantification (∀x)
- `exists x (...)` — Existential quantification (∃x)

### Connectives
- `->` — Implication (→)
- `<->` — Biconditional (↔)
- `&` — Conjunction (∧)
- `|` — Disjunction (∨)
- `-` — Negation (¬)

### Examples

```
# All men are mortal, Socrates is a man
all x (man(x) -> mortal(x))
man(socrates)

# Transitivity of greater-than
all x all y all z ((greater(x, y) & greater(y, z)) -> greater(x, z))
```

## Verbosity Control

All tools support a `verbosity` parameter:

| Level | Description | Use Case |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| `minimal` | Just success/result | Token-efficient LLM chains |
| `standard` | + message, bindings, engineUsed | Default balance |
| `detailed` | + Prolog program, statistics | Debugging |

---

## Limitations (Current)

1. **Model Size** — Finder limited to domains ≤25 elements (using SAT)
2. **Inference Depth** — Complex proofs may exceed default limit (increase via `inference_limit` or use `iterative` strategy)
3. **Higher-Order** — Only first-order logic supported

Future improvements may address these limitations as real-world usage dictates.

## Development

```bash
pnpm run build     # Compile TypeScript
pnpm test          # Run test suite
pnpm run dev       # Development mode with auto-reload
```

- [ ] **Neural-Guided** — LLM-suggested proof paths with validation

## Troubleshooting

### WASM Engines (Z3 / Clingo)
If you encounter errors related to `z3-solver` or `clingo-wasm`:
1. Ensure your environment supports WebAssembly.
2. In browser environments, ensure the `.wasm` files are served correctly. The `check` command can verify basic functionality in Node.js.
3. If you see `OOM` or memory errors, try running with the default engine (Prolog) or increasing the timeout/inference limits.

### build:browser Failures
Ensure you have run `pnpm install` to get the latest type definitions. The browser build relies on specific overrides for WASM modules that are handled in `src/engines/*/index.ts`.
